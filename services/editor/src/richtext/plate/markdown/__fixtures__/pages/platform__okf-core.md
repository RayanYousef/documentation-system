`@platform/okf-core` implements the OKF Core profile (a strict subset of Google's Open Knowledge Format v0.2) plus the platform's own extensions: code maps and log generation. It has zero runtime dependencies and its core is file-system agnostic: every function takes a `Record<bundleRelativePath, text>` and returns text to write, so the same code runs in Node (CLI, `LocalFolderBackend`, the site prebuild) and in the browser (`GithubBrowserBackend` regenerates before every commit).

## Layout

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/frontmatter.ts` | `parseFrontmatter`, `parseYamlSubset` (a deliberate YAML subset: scalars, inline and block lists, `- key: value` items) |
| `src/model.ts` | `analyzeBundle`, reserved names (`index.md`, `log.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`), `code-maps/` as the reserved generated folder, `BLOB_RE`, allowed index keys |
| `src/validate.ts` | `validatePage`, `validateBundle`, `checkLinks` |
| `src/index-block.ts` | render and splice the block between `<!-- okf:index -->` and `<!-- /okf:index -->` |
| `src/manifest.ts` | `buildManifest`, `renderManifest` |
| `src/codemap.ts` | `renderCodeMap`, `codeMapPath` (`code-maps/<owner>--<repo>.md`) |
| `src/generate.ts` | `generateBundle`, `checkBundle` |
| `src/log.ts` | `prependLogEntries`, `logEntriesFromCommits`, `validateLog`, `formatLogEntry` |
| `src/rewrite.ts` | `rewriteRefs` (branch to sha in blob URLs and viewer `ref` attributes) |
| `src/node/fs.ts`, `src/node/cli.ts` | `readBundle`, `writeFiles`, `runCli`; exported from the `@platform/okf-core/node` entry |
| `bin/okf.js` | `okf generate` or `okf check` on a bundle directory, with `--repo owner/repo` repeated per code repo |

## What a run produces

1. Index blocks in every folder `index.md`: `## Pages` and `## Folders` bullets, each a link titled with the page title followed by ` - ` and its description, descriptions copied verbatim from page frontmatter or the child folder's intro paragraph, ordered by `sidebar_position` (missing = 999) then title. Markers are created at the end of an index that lacks them; text outside them is preserved byte for byte.
2. `manifest.json`: flat array sorted by route with `route`, `file`, `title`, `description`, `type`, `tags`, `resource`, `sources`. Not written while problems remain.
3. Code maps: also not written while problems remain. One `code-maps/<owner>--<repo>.md` per declared repository, a path-ordered list of every path cited by `resource` or `sources` with the pages that cite it (`(source)` marks a sources citation). Keyed by `owner/repo`, so a repository declared once covers every path in it, including this platform's own code once pages cite it.
4. Log entries: the content service turns each write into `LogEntry` objects and calls `prependLogEntries`; `logEntriesFromCommits` exists for backends that read git history. The validator checks log format and date ordering only (completeness is guaranteed by the write path).

When problems exist, `generate` still rewrites the index blocks but writes neither `manifest.json` nor any code map until the problems are fixed.

Generated text is compared with line endings normalised to LF, so a CRLF checkout is never reported as stale.

## Validator rules

`rule` values in the problem list: `frontmatter` (concept page with missing frontmatter, `title`, `description` or `type`), `resource` (`resource` or a `sources[].resource` not matching `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<ref>/<path>`), `undeclared-repo` (points at a repository not passed with `--repo`; skipped when no repos are declared), `link` (relative link whose target does not exist), `missing-index` (a folder that holds Markdown but has no `index.md`), `index-frontmatter` (index without `title`, index keys other than `title` and `sidebar_position`; the root index may also carry `okf_version` and must declare `okf_version: "0.2"`), `log` (log frontmatter keys other than `title` and `sidebar_position`, headings not `## YYYY-MM-DD`, dates not strictly descending, malformed bullets), and `stale` (check mode only: any generated file a run would change).

## Running it

`scripts/okf.mjs` reads `platform.config.js`, builds the bundle list (`site/docs` plus `site/versioned_docs/version-<v>` for every entry in `site/versions.json`) and calls `runCli` with `--repo owner/repo` for each `codeRepos` entry. `npm run okf:generate` writes; `npm run okf:check` validates and exits 1 on any problem or stale file. Exit code 2 is a usage error.
