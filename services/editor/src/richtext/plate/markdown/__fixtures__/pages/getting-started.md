:::note
Skyforge is a fictional game. The project in `examples/unity-project` is a documentation sample made of C# stubs and placeholder meshes. It has no scenes, addressables or project settings, so it cannot be opened or played in Unity. The steps below describe the intended setup for the real game.
:::

## Prerequisites

Skyforge targets **Unity 6000.0.32f1** with the Universal Render Pipeline. Install it through Unity Hub together with the Windows and Android build modules.

## Clone and open

```
git clone https://github.com/RayanYousef/documentation-system.git
cd documentation-system/examples/unity-project
```

Open the folder from Unity Hub. In the real game the first import takes around six minutes on a laptop because the addressables catalog is rebuilt. Once the editor is up, load `Assets/Scenes/Bootstrap.unity` and press Play; the bootstrap scene spins up the service container and loads the hangar.

## Where to go next

The runtime is split into services registered at startup. The three you will touch most are described under [Systems](systems/): start with the [Inventory](systems/inventory.md), which nearly everything else depends on, and then read [Save System](systems/save-system.md) to understand how state survives between sessions.

If you are here to author content rather than code, jump to [Assets](assets/) instead. Architecture questions that were already argued out live under [Decisions](decisions/); check there before reopening a debate.
