## Contents

:::note
The `Airship.fbx` in the sample repository is a generated placeholder cube made for testing the FBX viewer. The meshes, LOD budgets and sockets below describe the intended shipped model, not the placeholder file.
:::

`Airship.fbx` is meant to contain the hull, deck, balloon and rigging as separate meshes under a single root, plus the LOD group. The hull is 18k triangles at LOD0, 7k at LOD1 and 1.5k at LOD2; the balloon is a low-poly shell with a normal map doing the work. Textures are 2048 albedo, 2048 normal and a 1024 packed mask (metallic, occlusion, emissive) in the URP Lit layout.

## Sockets

Gameplay code finds attachment points by name, so the socket transforms inside the FBX are part of the contract with [Combat](../systems/combat.md) and the crew system:

* `Socket_Turret_L01` to `Socket_Turret_R04` - eight turret mounts.
* `Socket_Sail_Main`, `Socket_Sail_Jib` - sail attachment for the rigging shader.
* `Socket_Hold` - origin of the cargo hold used by the [Inventory](../systems/inventory.md) drop logic.

Renaming a socket is a breaking change and needs a note in the change log.

## Import settings

Scale factor 1, no animation import, mesh compression off for LOD0 only. Read/Write is disabled; nothing at runtime needs the vertex data on the CPU.

## Preview

The mesh below is fetched from the sample code repository at the pinned ref, so a frozen version always shows the model that shipped.

A glTF asset committed to the site itself is referenced by `src` instead:
