title: Add an auth provider
description: "Step-by-step recipe for a new AuthProvider (for example the Phase 2 password provider): the interface and credentials union to extend, the contract suite to pass, where the site's in-place editing composition root selects it, the sign-in panel to register and which config field switches it on."

Existing providers are never modified; a new mechanism is a new class. `MockAuthProvider` is the smallest complete example to copy.

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| Contract to implement | `AuthProvider { id; login(credentials): Promise<Session>; verify(session): Promise<Identity> }` in `packages/contracts/src/auth.ts` |
| Contract test to run | `describeAuthProviderContract` from `@platform/contracts/testing` (built into `packages/contracts/src/testing/authProviderContract.ts`) |
| Composition root to register in | `site/src/platform/inplace/createInPlaceHost.ts` (the in-place editor's host), plus a sign-in panel in `services/editor/src/inplace/signInPanels.tsx` |
| Config field | `auth.provider` in `platform.config.js`; the union in `PlatformConfig['auth']['provider']` |
| Boundary rule | `services/auth` imports only `@platform/contracts` and `@platform/okf-core`; nothing may import a provider except a composition root |

## Steps

1. **Extend the credentials union.** In `packages/contracts/src/auth.ts` add a member to `Credentials`, e.g. `PasswordCredentials { kind: 'password'; username: string; password: string }`. Existing providers reject any other kind with `UNSUPPORTED_CREDENTIALS` through their own kind check (`MockAuthProvider.ts`, `GithubTokenProvider.ts`); the contract suite only tests the `mock` and `github-token` pair, so add a test for the new kind if you want it covered.
2. **Widen the config union.** In `packages/contracts/src/platform-config.ts` add the new id to `auth.provider` (`'github-token' | 'mock' | 'password'`).
3. **Implement the provider** in `services/auth/src/<Name>Provider.ts` with a stable `id` equal to the config value. `login` must return `{ provider: this.id, token, createdAt }`; `verify` must throw `AuthError('INVALID_CREDENTIALS')` for a session that does not belong to it, `NOT_COLLABORATOR` for an authenticated identity without write access (when the mechanism can express that), and `NETWORK` for transport failures. Export it from `services/auth/src/index.ts`.
4. **Pass the contract suite.** Create `services/auth/test/<Name>Provider.test.ts` and call `describeAuthProviderContract('<Name>Provider', async () => ({ provider, validCredentials, invalidCredentials, nonCollaboratorCredentials? }))`. Inject `fetch` or any I/O through the constructor so the test needs no network (see `test/fakeGithubAuth.ts`). Run `npm test -w @platform/auth`.
5. **Register it** in `site/src/platform/inplace/createInPlaceHost.ts`: today the live site always gets `GithubTokenProvider` and the dev server (`local-disk` mode) gets `MockAuthProvider`. Choose the new class from `config.auth.provider` there. This folder is the `site-composition` lint element, the only site code allowed to import `@platform/auth`.
6. **Register a sign-in panel** for the new provider id in `services/editor/src/inplace/signInPanels.tsx`: its intro text, input label and placeholder, whether the input is secret, how the typed value becomes `Credentials`, and the remember-me warning. The sign-in dialog shows a clear error for a provider without a panel; the rest of the editor only sees `Session` and `Identity`.
7. **Set the config**: `auth: { provider: 'password' }` in `platform.config.js`. Secrets never go in that file; a server-side provider reads them from the environment (see the [Roadmap](../roadmap.md) for the Phase 2 password provider design).
8. **Verify**: `npm run lint` (boundary rule), `npm test`, and `npm run e2e -w @platform/site` (the sign-in spec mocks GitHub; add a spec for the new provider).
